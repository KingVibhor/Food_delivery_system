# Food_delivery_system

In this projefct we have made a food delivery system which takes orders from particular food joints and delivers it to some specified locations.
This project is just a prototype to calculate the shortest distance it would take from the food joint to another and calculate it's delivery charges accordingly.

This system uses various data structures like Trees, Linked List, Graph.
It uses prim's algorithm to calulate delivery charges by calculating the minimum spanning tree of the graph.
It uses dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest distance the delivery guy will take to deliver the food.
We also use AVL tree for every restaurant so that each restaurant can store the order details and the tree data structure keeps balancing itself based on order id.
Linked list is used in this system so that the system can have a centralised storage so that it could count the total no of orders the system has taken into it.
